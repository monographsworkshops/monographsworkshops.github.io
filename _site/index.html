<p>Monographs are the most important and long-lasting output of systematics research. Nonetheless, publication numbers and training effort do not reflect the importance and value of these integrative, data-rich syntheses on the biodiversity of an organismal lineage: few contemporary professional systematists produce monographs and young students in systematics are rarely trained to do so. Why? Monographs are usually monumental works, the accumulation of years of study and data collection to document the taxonomy (including nomenclatural history, voucher information, phenotypic measurements, molecular analyses, and species delimitation) of a group of organisms.</p>

<p>With support from the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1839202&amp;HistoricalAwards=false">National Science Foundation</a>, we are running a series of workshops aimed at catalyzing a shift in the practice and perception of monography. In addition to stimulating interactions between systematists who conduct monographic studies in diverse taxonomic groups and between systematists who work on questions that are or could be integrated into monographs, these workshops will engage the community of database scientists, computational biologist, app developers, and others to find novel solutions to the challenges of data access and integration.</p>
