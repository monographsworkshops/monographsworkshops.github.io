### Agenda

**Friday May 17**

- 8:45 AM **Arrive**

- 9:00 AM **Overview of the project.** (Felipe Zapata and Marymegan Daly): What is the problem? what have we done so far? What are our goals for the next 2 days? what comes next?

- 9:15 - 9:45 AM **Introductions**

**Coffee Break**

- 10:00 - 11:00 AM **Build a Monographic Workflow.** What is the process of building a monograph?  What are the inputs required at each step?  Where are there rate-limiting factors at play?

- 11:15 - 12:00 PM **Developer/Tool showcase.** _Brief_ overview of the tools from the developers. Focus on what the tool can do and what it requires of the user.

**Lunch**

- 1:30 - 2:30 PM **Refine the Monographic Workflow.** Where do the tools described fit into the workflows? Are there steps/inputs/issues missing from this scheme?

**Coffee Break**

- 2:45 - 4:45 PM **Explode the Monographic Workflow.** How can we rethink some aspect of the workflow so that it works better or more seamlessly/effectively supports the end goal

- 5:00 - 6:00 PM **Discuss the Workflow.** Progress report: What was fixed in the workflow? how? were some solutions discarded? why? What compnents pof the workflow were inviolate and not discussed, in terms of potential improvements? What remains to be done for each component of the workflow?

**Saturday May 18**

- 8:45 AM **Arrive**

- 9:00 - 10:30 AM **The future of Publications.** How do we move from the product of our workflow to a publication? What are the challenges and opportunities in publishing these kinds of projects? Data repositories, code sharing, science reproducibility, dynamic documents.

**Coffee Break**

- 11:00 - 12:30 AM **The workflow to publication.** How do our thoughts on publication pathways and demands necessitate changes to (or benefit from) the pipelines and workflows we discussed?

**Lunch**

- 1:30 - 2:30 PM **Scaling up and building out.** How do we get the tools into the hands of the people who can use them?  How do we change modes and mores for publication? What roadblocks are there for dissemination (for developers) or adoption (for users)? How might those challenges be surmounted?

**Coffee Break**

- 4:00 - 5:00 PM **Wrap up and next steps.**
